		<section id="about">
			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a recent graduate from Washington University in St. Louis with a
				B.S. in Computer Science. I also recieved a B.S. in Chemistry from
				University of Redlands, which is where I found my passion in CS during
				my final year.
			</p>
			<p>
				I always have had the dream of being able to directly help others.
				Previously, I was pre-med with hopes of becoming a doctor so that I
				could fulfil this dream. However, the fall before graduating I found a
				passion for computer science. I had the realization that I can still
				help others in their everyday life through the role of a software
				engineer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I aim to make an impact and offer solutions to those all around the
				globe.
			</p>
